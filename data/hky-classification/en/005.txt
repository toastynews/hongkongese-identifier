Hong Kong Observatory says typhoon signal No 1 to remain in place as Tropical Depression Yagi edges closer to the city

Heavy showers and squalls expected throughout the day

The Hong Kong Observatory has said the typhoon signal No 1 will remain in place throughout Saturday, having earlier said it would consider issuing the No 3 signal.

At noon, the weather forecaster estimated Tropical Depression Yagi to be about 230 km west-southwest of the city, having made landfall near Yangjiang in western Guangdong.

An Observatory spokesman said the authority would keep monitoring wind strength before taking further action.

He added heavy rain was expected in Kwai Tsing, Tsuen Wan and Sham Shui Po and warned there could be flooding in low-lying areas.
